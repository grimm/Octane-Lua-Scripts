# turntableG

Octane Render turntable animation script.  This script allows the user to choose a render target and then animate that camera around the origin.  The user can select the degrees of rotation, the number of frames, and either preview the motion or render the final animation.  There are other options to spiral in or out the camera or have the camera rotate on another axis. 

### To install

install all of the files in your Octane script directory.  This directory can be setup in Octane's preferences if you don't have one.  You can also just point Octane to the files but it will work better if you have a defined script directory.

### Script shortcut
ctrl + t
